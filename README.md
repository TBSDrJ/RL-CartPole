# Reinforcement Learning

I am trying to build a minimal reinforcement learning example, solving the cartpole problem.

I started with [Training a Deep Q Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/1_dqn_tutorial), but that is pretty far from minimal, and I was struggling to minimize it.

Then, in the process of trying to understand how to minimize it, I found this example: [Replay Buffers: Using replay buffers during training](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/5_replay_buffers_tutorial#using_replay_buffers_during_training).

So, I'm going to kick the tires on this more minimal example here first.
